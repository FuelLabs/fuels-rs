Rust SDK for Fuel. It can be used for a variety of things, including but not limited to:

- Compiling, deploying, and testing [Sway](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway) contracts;
- Launching a local Fuel network;
- Crafting and signing transactions with hand-crafted scripts or contract calls;
- Generating type-safe Rust bindings of contract methods;
- And more, `fuels-rs` is still in active development.
