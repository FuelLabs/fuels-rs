# Retrying requests

The [`Provider`](https://docs.rs/fuels/0.47.0/fuels/accounts/provider/struct.Provider.html) can be configured to retry a request upon receiving a `io::Error`.

> Note: Currently all node errors are received as `io::Error`s. So, if configured, a retry will happen even if, for example, a transaction failed to verify.

We can configure the number of retry attempts and the retry strategy as detailed below.

## `RetryConfig`

The retry behavior can be altered by giving a custom `RetryConfig`. It allows for configuring the maximum number of attempts and the interval strategy used.

```rust, ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels-accounts/src/provider/retry_util.rs:retry_config}}
```

```rust, ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/providers/src/lib.rs:configure_retry}}
```

## Interval strategy - `Backoff`

`Backoff` defines different strategies for managing intervals between retry attempts.
Each strategy allows you to customize the waiting time before a new attempt based on the number of attempts made.

### Variants

- `Linear(Duration)`: `Default` Increases the waiting time linearly with each attempt.
- `Exponential(Duration)`: Doubles the waiting time with each attempt.
- `Fixed(Duration)`: Uses a constant waiting time between attempts.

```rust, ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels-accounts/src/provider/retry_util.rs:backoff}}
```
