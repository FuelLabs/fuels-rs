# Connecting to the Testnet or an external node

We can interact with the `Testnet` node by using the following example.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/providers/src/lib.rs:connect_to_testnet}}
```

In the code example, we connected a new provider to the Testnet node and created a new wallet from a private key.

> **Note:** New wallets on the Testnet will not have any assets! They can be obtained by providing the wallet address to the faucet at
>
>[faucet-beta-4.fuel.network](https://faucet-beta-4.fuel.network)
>
> Once the assets have been transferred to the wallet, you can reuse it in other tests by providing the private key!
>
> In addition to the faucet, there is a block explorer for the Tesnet at

If you want to connect to another node just change the url or IP and port. For example, to connect to a local node that was created with `fuel-core` you can use:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/providers/src/lib.rs:local_node_address}}
```
