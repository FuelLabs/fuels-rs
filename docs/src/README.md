# The Fuel Rust SDK

Rust SDK for Fuel. It can be used for a variety of things, including but not limited to:

- Compiling, deploying, and testing [Sway](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway) contracts;
- Launching a local Fuel network;
- Crafting and signing transactions with hand-crafted scripts or contract calls;
- Generating type-safe Rust bindings of contract methods;
- And more, `fuels-rs` is still in active development.


This book is an overview of the different things one can achieve using the Rust SDK, and how to implement them. Keep in mind that both the SDK and the documentation are works-in-progress!
