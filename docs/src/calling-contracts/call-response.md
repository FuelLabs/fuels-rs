# Call response

<!-- This section should why you have to chain `.call().await.unwrap()` so often -->
<!-- chaining:example:start -->
You've probably noticed that you're often chaining `.call().await.unwrap()`. That's because:

1. You have to choose between `.call()` and `.simulate()` (more on this in the next section).
2. Contract calls are asynchronous, so you can choose to either `.await` it or perform concurrent tasks, making full use of Rust's async.
3. `.unwrap()` the `Result<FuelCallResponse, Error>` returned by the contract call.
<!-- chaining:example:end -->

<!-- This section should preface what the `FuelCallResponse` is -->
<!-- call_resp:example:start -->
Once you unwrap the `FuelCallResponse`, you have access to this struct:
<!-- call_resp:example:end -->

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels-programs/src/call_response.rs:fuel_call_response}}
```

<!-- This section should explain the fields of the `FuelCallResponse` struct -->
<!-- call_resp_fields:example:start -->
Where `value` will hold the value returned by its respective contract method, represented by the exact type returned by the FuelVM, E.g., if your contract returns a FuelVM's `u64`, `value`'s `D` will be a `u64`. If it's a FuelVM's tuple `(u8,bool)`, then `D` will be a `(u8,bool)`. If it's a custom type, for instance, a Sway struct `MyStruct` containing two components, a `u64`, and a `b256`, `D` will be a struct generated at compile-time, called `MyStruct` with `u64` and a `[u8; 32]` (the equivalent of `b256` in Rust).

- `receipts` will hold all [receipts](https://specs.fuel.network/master/protocol/abi/receipts.html) generated by that specific contract call.
- `gas_used` is the amount of gas it consumed by the contract call.
- `tx_id` will hold the ID of the corresponding submitted transaction.

## Error handling

<!-- This section should explain how to use the `is_ok` and `is_err` methods for a call response -->
<!-- call_resp_ok:example:start -->
You can use the `is_ok` and `is_err` methods to check if a contract call `Result` is `Ok` or contains an error. These methods will return either `true` or `false`.
<!-- call_resp_ok:example:end -->

<!-- This section should show an example of how to use the `is_ok` and `is_err` methods for a call response -->
<!-- call_resp_ok_code:example:start -->
```rust, ignore
let is_ok = response.is_ok();
let is_error = response.is_err();
```
<!-- call_resp_ok_code:example:end -->

<!-- This section should explain how to use the `unwrap_err` method for a call response -->
<!-- call_resp_error:example:start -->
If `is_err` returns `true`, you can use the `unwrap_err` method to unwrap the error message.
<!-- call_resp_error:example:end -->

<!-- This section should show an example of how to unwrap a call response error -->
<!-- call_resp_error_code:example:start -->
```rust, ignore
if response.is_err() {
    let err = response.unwrap_err();
    println!("ERROR: {:?}", err);
};
```
<!-- call_resp_error_code:example:end -->
