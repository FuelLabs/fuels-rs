# Setting up test wallets

You'll often want to create one or more test wallets when testing your contracts. Here's how to do it.

## Setting up multiple test wallets

<!-- This section should explain setting up multiple test wallets -->
<!-- test_wallets:example:start -->
If you need multiple test wallets, they can be set up using the `launch_custom_provider_and_get_wallets` method.
<!-- test_wallets:example:end -->

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/wallets/src/lib.rs:multiple_wallets_helper}}
```

<!-- This section should explain how to customize test wallets -->
<!-- custom_test_wallets:example:start -->
You can customize your test wallets via `WalletsConfig`.
<!-- custom_test_wallets:example:end -->

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/wallets/src/lib.rs:setup_5_wallets}}
```

<!-- This section should explain that test wallets are deterministic -->
<!-- deterministic:example:start -->
>**Note** Wallets generated with `launch_provider_and_get_wallet` or `launch_custom_provider_and_get_wallets`
will have deterministic addresses.
<!-- deterministic:example:end -->

## Setting up a test wallet with multiple random assets

You can create a test wallet containing multiple assets (including the base asset to pay for gas).

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/wallets/src/lib.rs:multiple_assets_wallet}}
```

- coins: `Vec<(UtxoId, Coin)>` has `num_assets` * `coins_per_assets` coins (UTXOs)
- asset_ids: `Vec<AssetId>` contains the `num_assets` randomly generated `AssetId`s (always includes the base asset)

## Setting up a test wallet with multiple custom assets

You can also create assets with specific `AssetId`s, coin amounts, and number of coins.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/wallets/src/lib.rs:custom_assets_wallet}}
```

This can also be achieved directly with the `WalletsConfig`.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/wallets/src/lib.rs:custom_assets_wallet_short}}
```

>**Note** In this case, you need to manually add the base asset and the corresponding number of
>coins and coin amount

## Setting up assets

The Fuel blockchain holds many different assets; you can create your asset with its unique `AssetId` or create random assets for testing purposes.

You can use only one asset to pay for transaction fees and gas: the base asset, whose `AssetId` is `0x000...0`, a 32-byte zeroed value.

For testing purposes, you can configure coins and amounts for assets. You can use `setup_multiple_assets_coins`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/wallets/src/lib.rs:multiple_assets_coins}}
```

>**Note** If setting up multiple assets, one of these assets will always be the base asset.

If you want to create coins only with the base asset, then you can use:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/providers/src/lib.rs:setup_single_asset}}
```

>**Note** Choosing a large number of coins and assets for `setup_multiple_assets_coins` or `setup_single_asset_coins` can lead to considerable runtime for these methods. This will be improved in the future but for now, we recommend using up to **1_000_000** coins, or **1000** coins and assets simultaneously.
