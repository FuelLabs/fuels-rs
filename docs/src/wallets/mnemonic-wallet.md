# Creating a wallet from mnemonic phrases

A mnemonic phrase is a cryptographically-generated sequence of words that's used to derive a private key. For instance: `"oblige salon price punch saddle immune slogan rare snap desert retire surprise";` would generate the address `0xdf9d0e6c6c5f5da6e82e5e1a77974af6642bdb450a10c43f0c6910a212600185`.

In addition to that, we also support [Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-are-hierarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets) and [derivation paths](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/derivation-paths). You may recognize the string `"m/44'/60'/0'/0/0"` from somewhere; that's a derivation path. In simple terms, it's a way to derive many wallets from a single root wallet.

The SDK gives you two wallets from mnemonic instantiation methods: one that takes a derivation path (`Wallet::new_from_mnemonic_phrase_with_path`) and one that uses the default derivation path, in case you don't want or don't need to configure that (`Wallet::new_from_mnemonic_phrase`).

Here's how you can create wallets with both mnemonic phrases and derivation paths:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/wallets/src/lib.rs:create_wallet_from_mnemonic}}
```
