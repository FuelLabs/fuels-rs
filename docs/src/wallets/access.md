# Wallet Access

<!-- This section should explain the difference between the different types of wallets -->
<!-- wallet_types:example:start -->
The kinds of operations we can perform with a `Wallet` instance depend on
whether or not we have access to the wallet's private key.

In order to differentiate between `Wallet` instances that know their private key
and those that do not, we use the `WalletUnlocked` and `Wallet` types
respectively.

## Wallet States

<!-- This section should explain the unlocked wallet type -->
<!-- wallet_unlocked:example:start -->
The `WalletUnlocked` type represents a wallet whose private key is known and
stored internally in memory. A wallet must be of type `WalletUnlocked` in order
to perform operations that involve signing messages or
transactions.
<!-- wallet_unlocked:example:end -->
You can learn more about signing [here](./signing.md).

<!-- This section should explain the locked wallet type -->
<!-- wallet_locked:example:start -->
The `Wallet` type represents a wallet whose private key is *not* known or stored
in memory. Instead, `Wallet` only knows its public address. A `Wallet` cannot be
used to sign transactions, however it may still perform a whole suite of useful
operations including listing transactions, assets, querying balances, and so on.
<!-- wallet_locked:example:end -->

Note that the `WalletUnlocked` type provides a `Deref` implementation targeting
its inner `Wallet` type. This means that all methods available on the `Wallet`
type are also available on the `WalletUnlocked` type. In other words,
`WalletUnlocked` can be thought of as a thin wrapper around `Wallet` that
provides greater access via its private key.

## Transitioning States

A `Wallet` instance can be unlocked by providing the private key:

```rust,ignore
let wallet_unlocked = wallet_locked.unlock(private_key);
```

A `WalletUnlocked` instance can be locked using the `lock` method:

```rust,ignore
let wallet_locked = wallet_unlocked.lock();
```

Most wallet constructors that create or generate a new wallet are provided on
the `WalletUnlocked` type. Consider locking the wallet with the `lock` method after the new private
key has been handled in order to reduce the scope in which the wallet's private
key is stored in memory.

## Design Guidelines

When designing APIs that accept a wallet as an input, we should think carefully
about the kind of access that we require. API developers should aim to minimise
their usage of `WalletUnlocked` in order to ensure private keys are stored in
memory no longer than necessary to reduce the surface area for attacks and
vulnerabilities in downstream libraries and applications.
