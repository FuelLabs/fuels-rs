# Setup instructions for the Fuel SDK


## What you will need on your machine

- Rust 2021 ([see here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html))
- A clone of the `fuels-rs` repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs
```

That's it! Thanks to the awesome `cargo` package management, you don't need to install the Fuel 
node or Sway yourself.
