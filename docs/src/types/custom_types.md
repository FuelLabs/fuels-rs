# Structs and enums

<!-- This section should explain how to get the custom types from a Sway program -->
<!-- custom_types:example:start -->
The structs and enums you define in your Sway code have equivalents automatically generated by the SDK's `abigen!` macro.
<!-- custom_types:example:end -->

For instance, if in your Sway code you have a struct called `CounterConfig` that looks like this:

```rust,ignore
struct CounterConfig {
  dummy: bool,
  initial_value: u64,
}
```

After using the `abigen!` macro, `CounterConfig` will be accessible in your Rust file! Here's an example:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels/tests/types_contracts.rs:struct_generation}}
```

You can freely use your custom types (structs or enums) within this scope. That also means passing custom types to functions and receiving custom types from function calls.

## Manual decoding

Suppose you wish to decode raw bytes into a type used in your contract and the `abigen!` generated this type, then you can use `try_into`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels/tests/types_contracts.rs:manual_decode}}
```

Otherwise, for native types such as `u8`, `u32`,...,`ContractId` and others, you must use `::fuels::core::try_from_bytes`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/rust_bindings/src/lib.rs:manual_decode_native}}
```

## Generics

The Fuel Rust SDK supports both generic enums and generic structs. If you're already familiar with Rust, it's your typical `struct MyStruct<T>` type of generics support.

For instance, your Sway contract could look like this:

```Rust
contract;

use std::hash::sha256;

struct SimpleGeneric<T> {
    single_generic_param: T,
}

abi MyContract {
  fn struct_w_generic(arg1: SimpleGeneric<u64>) -> SimpleGeneric<u64>;
}

impl MyContract for Contract {
    fn struct_w_generic(arg1: SimpleGeneric<u64>) -> SimpleGeneric<u64> {
        let expected = SimpleGeneric {
            single_generic_param: 123u64,
        };

        assert(arg1.single_generic_param == expected.single_generic_param);

        expected
    }
}
```

Your Rust code would look like this:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels/tests/types_contracts.rs:generic}}
```
