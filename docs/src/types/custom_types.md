# Structs and enums

The structs and enums you define in your Sway code have equivalents automatically generated by the SDK's `abigen!` macro.

For instance, if in your Sway code you have a struct called `CounterConfig` that looks like this:

```rust,ignore
struct CounterConfig {
  dummy: bool,
  initial_value: u64,
}
```

After using the `abigen!` macro, `CounterConfig` will be accessible in your Rust file! Here's an example:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels/tests/harness.rs:struct_generation}}
```

You can freely use your custom types (structs or enums) within this scope. That also means passing custom types to functions and receiving custom types from function calls.

## Manual decoding

Suppose you wish to decode raw bytes into a type used in your contract and the `abigen!` generated this type, then you can use `try_into`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels/tests/harness.rs:manual_decode}}
```

Otherwise, for native types such as `u8`, `u32`,...,`ContractId` and others, you must use `::fuels::core::try_from_bytes`:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/rust_bindings/src/lib.rs:manual_decode_native}}
```
