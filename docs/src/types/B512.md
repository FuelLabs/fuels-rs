# `B512`

In the Rust SDK, the `B512` definition matches the Sway standard library type with the same name and will be converted accordingly when interacting with contracts:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels-core/src/types/core/bits.rs:b512}}
```

Here's an example:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../e2e/tests/types_contracts.rs:b512_example}}
```
