# Vectors

## Passing in vectors

You can pass a Rust `std::vec::Vec` into your contract method transparently. The following code calls a Sway contract method which accepts a `Vec<SomeStruct<u32>>`.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../e2e/tests/types_contracts.rs:passing_in_vec}}
```

You can use a vector just like you would use any other type -- e.g. a `[Vec<u32>; 2]` or a `SomeStruct<Vec<Bits256>>` etc.

## Returning vectors

Returning vectors from contract methods is supported transparently, with the caveat that you cannot have them nested inside another type. This limitation is temporary.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../e2e/tests/types_contracts.rs:returning_vec}}
```

> **Note: you can still interact with contracts containing methods that return vectors nested inside another type, just not interact with the methods themselves**
