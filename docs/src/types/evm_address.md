# `EvmAddress`

In the Rust SDK, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) addresses can be represented with the `EvmAddress` type. Its definition matches with the Sway standard library type with the same name and will be converted accordingly when interacting with contracts:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels-core/src/types/core/bits.rs:evm_address}}
```

Here's an example:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../packages/fuels/tests/bindings.rs:evm_address_arg}}
```

> **Note:** when creating an `EvmAddress` from `Bits256`, the first 12 bytes will be cleared because an EVM address is only 20 bytes long.
